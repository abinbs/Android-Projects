# Apps

My first try in app development.<br/>
<h3>MyApp:<br/></h3> A simple Calculator with basic arithmetic features.<br/>
<h3> Networkingsample:<br/></h3>
  A simple HTML Viewer.<br/>
<h3> Well_Cared:<br/></h3> An app for the Elderly.An app that provides four services to the elderly namely<br/>
<ol>
  <li><h6> Maid Search:</h6></li>
    Finding a trustworthy maid is now an easy task just by searching in this app.<br/>
  <li><h6> Medicine:</h6></li>
All they hve to do is to take a picture of the prescription and we would connect to our partners and would supply their medicines.<br/>
  <li><h6> Groceries:</h6></li>
    They only have to send us a list through the app and those items would be supplied to them.<br/>
  <li><h6> Take a tour:</h6></li>
    Our expeienced guides would take them for a trip t their dream destination and would care take them.<br/>
</ol>
